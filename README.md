Installing Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS in VirtualBox.
This tutorial assumes that you have already downloaded the Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS iso image from the Ubuntu website. This tutorial also assumes that VirtualBox is already installed and configured on your current system.
1.	Open VirtualBox Manager and click the ‘New’ button at the top-left of the window.

3.	Click the ‘Next >’ button to proceed. Select the amount of RAM that you want to allocate to your new virtual machine. Since Ubuntu Server is so light on resources, 1 GB (1024 MB) will be just fine for this tutorial.
